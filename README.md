# Choose Your Own Story - InBetween
### Overview
Welcome to InBetween, a Choose Your Own Story game! This project features an interactive narrative where players make choices that influence the outcome of the story. The game includes a fun and ridiculous storyline, created with lots of creativity and lots my hand-drawn art.

### The project is divided into two main parts:

InBetween-1.0-pc: The full downloadable game, where you can play the interactive story. The game features illustrations, branching paths, and different endings based on your decisions. To start playing, download the game and run the InBetween.exe file.

script.py: This file contains the entire script and storyline of the game, providing a clear view of all the possible paths, variables, and conversations in the game. The script is laid out for easy viewing and analysis, so you can explore the flow of the game or study the narrative structure.
